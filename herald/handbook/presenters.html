<a name="Father Sky Lodge"></a>


<h2>Father Sky Lodge</h2>
  <small>  Father Sky Lodge (FSL) is a group effort of Pagan men to provide support and resources to their community in order to encourage the exploration of Male Spirituality, the Male Mysteries and to return The Masculine Divine/God to a place of balance within Neopagan spirituality. It allows Pagan men to come together in fellowship and brotherhood.

Our goal is to create a place where anyone, man or woman, can come with questions about masculine Pagan Spirituality, and know that there would be answers; a place where any member of our Pagan community can freely ask  ``Can you help me?''  on matters related to Pagan Men, and know that the answer will always be a resounding  ``Yes!'' 

We are a brother group with Sisterhood of the Shield and work with them to support each other in our Spiritual journeys.  </small>

<a name="Sisterhood of the Shield"></a>


<h2>Sisterhood of the Shield</h2>
  <small>  Sisterhood of the Shield (StS) is a womens-only group. Though we embrace the traditional aspects of womanhood, we also seek the more primal and earthy energy; a place where the warrior women and other such traditions are as welcome as the maiden, mother and crone.

We have an Equalist mentality: Men and Women are equal but there are things that each experience that only someone of their own gender can understand.

We are a sister group with Father Sky Lodge and work with them to support each other in our Spiritual journeys.  </small>

I continued my training in Mexico, where I lived and worked with British, French, and Mayan healers. Through this winding journey I meet my ego, and found him to be a shy frightened and precocious child. I communicate with trees. I've been led by spirit to heal myself. My workshop will teach how to connect with divine earth energies, via surrendering to divinity.   </small>
