<h3 class="event">Solomonic Ritual - Invocation of the Elementals<a name="Leitch1" ></a></h3>
<small class="event-presenter"> <a href="presenters.html#Aaron Leitch">Aaron Leitch</a> </small> • 
<small class="event-venue">Morrigan&#039;s Arena</small>
<span class="event-details"> One of the fastest growing movements in the occult scene today is the revival of the Old Magick.  That is, magick as it was done before the rise of the 19th century magickal lodges (Golden Dawn, Thelema, etc) and modern Neopaganism and Wicca.  The Old Magick comes in many forms - from &quot;fam-trad&quot; witchcraft to the African Traditional Religions (Santeria, Palo, Voodoo), indigenous folk traditions (Hoodoo, Hexcraft, Stregheria) to native shamanism, and of course the medieval European spell books called &quot;grimoires&quot; that form the backbone of the Solomonic tradition (the Key of Solomon the King, Lemegeton, Heptameron, etc).<br>For the past one hundred years, the Solomonic grimoires have been conflated with the later lodge systems like the Golden Dawn, and are therefore often classified as &quot;ceremonial magick.&quot;  However, as outlined in Aaron Leitch&#039;s &quot;Secrets of the Magickal Grimoires&quot;, the magick of the grimoires is much more akin to sorcery, shamanism or folk magick.  If you are Pagan, you might be surprised by how familiar a Solomonic ritual will feel.<br>And now you have a rare opportunity to witness (or participate in) such a ritual for yourself!  FPG has invited grimoire masters Aaron Leitch and Carrie Mikell to perform a Solomonic Invocation of the Elementals.  We will be invoking the presence of the four classes of Elemental spirits (Salamanders, Undines, Sylphs and Gnomes) through the authority of the four &quot;demon&quot; Kings of the compass points.  They will be invited to partake of four Elemental offerings and in return will be asked to protect the festival grounds and guide all attendees in their own personal spiritual journeys.<br>While this will not be a full &quot;evocation to visible appearance&quot;, the spirits very likely will make their presence known to those who are sensitive enough to see or hear them.  Therefore we will be inviting any and all skryers to attend and participate in the invocations.  Also, ALL who attend will be welcome to write their own private petitions to the spirits. </span>
