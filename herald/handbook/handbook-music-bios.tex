{ Multi-award winning group Spiral Dance, based in Adelaide, has been playing exciting,
high-energy music to enthusiastic audiences throughout Australia and beyond for two
decades. With a combination of haunting vocals, intoxicating guitar riffs and groovy
accordion lines, underpinned with potent bass and dynamic percussion, the band presents
an eclectic blend of traditional folk-rock with powerful self-penned songs and tunes.
Rousing melodies intertwine with mythical tales that will spirit you into the realms of magick
and the mists of ancient time - music that will rock your ancestors!
