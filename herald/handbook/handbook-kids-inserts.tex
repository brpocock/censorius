      nearest Guardian \\ or Staff Member}
  \end{center}

  If you have a problem any time during Festival --- if someone gets
  hurt, scared, worried, or anything at all --- find a Guardian
  to help. Guardians carry staves (big walking-sticks) with a little red
  flag on top.

  If a Guardian asks you to do something, pay attention! They're here to
  keep you safe.

    posted near the pool.

    or beach after dark.
  \end{itemize}

  Get your parent's or guardian's permission before going into the pool area!

  \begingroup
  \setlength{\columnsep}{6pt}%
  \begin{wrapfigure}{l}{.5\columnwidth}
  \includegraphics[width=.5\columnwidth]{red-tent.png}
  \end{wrapfigure}

  Open all day for women and girls with their mothers; A great place
  to relax, meet newcomers and renew friendships.

  All who identify as girls or women are welcome to come share coffee,
  cookies and conversations in a beautiful and comfortable space
  filled with solidarity and great donated stuff for the benefit of
  the RT. No need to buy anything- treats and workshop materials are
  free. Just hang out, share advice, browse our library, read cards,
  eat chocolate and laugh a lot. Bring a chair if you can.

  \endgroup

  \subsection{Kids' Realm}

  Ask your adults to bring you to the Kids' Realm tent for supervised
  playtime and workshops with special presenters just for you --- up to
  age 12.

  Your parents will need to check you in, and out, from Kids'
  Realm. Make sure they read the rules about volunteering!

  In bad weather, Kids’ Realm will move into the Dining Hall.

  \subsection{Father Sky Lodge}

  \begingroup
  \setlength{\columnsep}{6pt}%
  \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.5\columnwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=.5\columnwidth]{FSL.png}
  \end{wrapfigure}

  Father Sky Lodge (FSL) is a group effort of Pagan men to provide
  support and resources to their community in order to encourage the
  exploration of Male Spirituality, the Male Mysteries and to return The
  Masculine Divine/God to a place of balance within Neopagan
  spirituality. It allows Pagan men to come together in fellowship and
  brotherhood.

  Our goal is to create a place where anyone, man or woman, can come
  with questions about masculine Pagan Spirituality, and know that
  there would be answers; a place where any member of our Pagan
  community can freely ask ``Can you help me?'' on matters related to
  Pagan Men, and know that the answer will always be a resounding
  ``Yes!''

  We are a brother group with Sisterhood of the Shield and work with
  them to support each other in our Spiritual journeys.

  \endgroup

  \subsection{Art Abandonment Project}

  The faeries are at it again! Keep your eyes open for random gifts of
  love just for us at FPG!

  If you find these little packages of fun marked ``FAE GIFT thanks to
  The Art Abandonment Project,'' they are yours to keep, trade or give
  to a loved one or friend!  All gifts will be randomly found around
  the campsite over the week except Vendors' Row (which is off-limits)
  \ldots Happy Samhain from the Fae!

  \subsection{Sisterhood of the Shield}

  \begingroup
  \setlength{\columnsep}{6pt}%
  \begin{wrapfigure}{l}{.5\columnwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=.5\columnwidth]{sts.png}
  \end{wrapfigure}

  Sisterhood of the Shield (StS) is a women’s-only group. Though we
  embrace the traditional aspects of womanhood, we also seek the more
  primal and earthy energy; a place where the warrior women and other
  such traditions are as welcome as the maiden, mother and crone.

  We have an Equalist mentality: Men and Women are equal but there are
  things that each experience that only someone of their own gender can
  understand.

  We are a sister group with Father Sky Lodge and work with them to
  support each other in our Spiritual journeys.

  \subsection{Tween Time}

  'Tween-agers have their special place to hang out and express
  themseves at Festival, too. Look for the Tween Tent near Kids' Realm!

\section{FPG Traditions}
\begin{multicols}{3}

  \subsection{Celtic Games}

  Celtic Games is an event that remembers days long past when kingdoms
  fought for control, power, riches, and territory; when kings and
  queens chose their champions to limit loss of life upon the
  battlefield. Will you be brave enough, strong enough, quick enough,
  or witty enough to take the coveted crown for your own and become
  King or Queen of FPG Celtic Games. 

  Lay on --- and may the most skilled sword claim victory!

  Your parents need to come with you to sign up. Ages 5 and up.

  \subsection{Fire Temple Drum Altar}

  The Drum \& Dance Altar is a place for participants \& performers to
  go to gain refreshment and sustenance (both physically and
  spiritually). It is built for the Community and by the Community.
  
  It would be appreciated if you would bring donation items to the
  drum circle before 10pm each night.

  Possible contributions include: blankets, rugs, tables, hay bales,
  candles, flowers, fruits, drinks, granola bars, and other midnight
  snacks. If you have any questions, stop by the Shiny Happy People Drum
  Tribe booth on Vendors’ Row anytime during the festival.


  \subsection{Coming Of Age}

  If you or someone you know is interested in participating in the
  Coming of Age ordeal, please contact Sage when he's over near Lodge 7,
  or at \texttt{Sage@star-hope.org}. Participants must be age 18--24 at
  next Samhain.

  \subsection{FPG Wants You!}

  If you've got some time and want to give back to the community, visit
  the Ministry of Magick office (near the Blue Room) to sign up for a
  Community Service volunteer shift --- you could even win free
  admission to your next FPG!
