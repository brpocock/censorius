Dear Spiral Dance:

Thank you for joining us at Florida Pagan Gathering! We're
so happy that you've chosen to share your wisdom and talents with the
FPG family.

In order to ensure that everything goes smoothly, we have three staff
members dedicated to supporting your events. Mystral is the
Co\"ordinator for our Production Division. Sage and Bruce-Robert are
Lugals (managers) assisting her. Naturally, any of our staff members
will be happy to assist you in whatever way they can as well.

\emph{Please} check in with any of these three as soon as you arrive!
Our Registration staff by the front gate can direct you to where they
can be found, or raise them on our camp-wide walkie-talkie system.

Please also ensure that you let the Production Division team know in
which cabin, lodge, or other area you're camping --- in case we
need to reach you during the Festival.

The following information lists the events for which you're
scheduled. If you see any errors or omissions, please let the
Production Division team know as soon as possible so that we can make
alternate arrangements.

Note that most of this information is also found in the FPG programmes
handed out at Registration.

Your contact information:  

Recording and photography will \emph{not} be allowed at your events.


\subsection*{Note:}

The time slot shown for an event is where it appears on the schedule
grid in the programme.

The ``Short (Grid) Name'' is the possibly-abbreviated name that will
appear on the schedule grid. The full title will be displayed in the
events listing.
