<img style="width:1in" src="DruAnn.png"></div>
Dru Ann is a dreamer and a believer. She began a journey down the proverbial rabbit hole of
self-discovery in 2002 and has never looked back. It is a journey that has taught her about
herself and about the way the world works. There have been bumps along the way but that is
always part of the journey. One of the biggest lessons she has learned is to believe. Believe in
everything! When you believe in everything strangely enough it seems everything believes in
you. &nbsp; &nbsp; <a rel="event" href="Events-SAT.html#DruAnn3">Learning to Let Spirit Be Your Guide </a>(<a rel="location" href="venues.html#Thunderdome">Thunderdome</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;Sat) •&nbsp;<a rel="event" href="Events-FRI.html#DruAnn2">Chromacoustics Healing with Sound and Color </a>(<a rel="location" href="venues.html#Arts & Crafts">Arts &amp; Crafts</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;Fri)  <small>(No recording)</small></div>
