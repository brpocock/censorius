\subsubsection{The Lost Secrets of Western Magick Revealed}
\label{Fri-Leitch2}
{\small Aaron Leitch $\bullet$  Blue Room}

 Have you ever noticed the distinct separation between modern Western occultism (i.e. Wicca, Thelema, Golden Dawn, Theosophy, the New Age, etc.) and the indigenous occultism practiced by the rest of the world? Our techniques are different in fundamental ways, and (historically) both sides have suffered from various amounts of disdain for one another.  Non-Western conjurors and shamans often describe our magick as more fantasy than reality.

This is because, during the Renaissance and the following Age of Enlightenment, the West left "superstition" behind and decided that everything could be viewed through the lens of science and psychology. Consequently, that is what their magick became, and it is why to this very day Western systems are accused of being "purely mental."

Of course, Western magick is hardly completely ineffective. That is merely a negative stereotype. But we can still learn new (or, better, re-learn very ancient) techniques to make our magick even stronger.  So, if you are struggling with your magick and would like to know why you aren't achieving the results you desire, or you simply want better results than you've attained in the past, or even if you are simply always seeking to expand your practice with powerful techniques that really work Â— then this is the lecture for you.

Bring your questions, as this will be an open discussion! {\small (All ages)}

\subsubsection{Intro to Evolutionary Astrology for Pagans, Part1}
\label{Fri-Mage2}

 Evolutionary Astrology is a newer field of astrology which incorporates the same basic foundations of astrological analysis (the chart, planets, signs, houses, etc.), but interprets the natal chart with a somewhat different set of questions.

In this workshop you will learn the first steps for finding in your birth chart what your Soul's desire and intention for this lifetime are. This will be an introduction to Evolutionary Astrology. If you are familiar with astrology, or are a veteran astrologer, you will be interested in this different perspective within an ancient and venerable discipline. If you have not explored astrology, this approach could reveal to you the good reasons you may want to start now! {\small (Ages 13 and up)}
