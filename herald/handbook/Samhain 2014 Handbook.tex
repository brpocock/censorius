\section{Safety}

\begin{multicols}{2}

  \begin{center}
    \textbf{\large \textsc{In case of emergency or injury} \\ please contact the
      nearest Guardian \\ or Staff Member}
  \end{center}

  Our volunteer Guardians of the Community, led by the fearless Sqrl,
  are a separate team who patrol the Festival and are here to help keep
  everyone safe. Keep an eye out for the Guardians' fund-raising booth
  as well. Remember, \emph{Guardians are sexy}!

  Please \emph{pay attention} to any instructions (or sternly-worded
  advice) from our Guardians!

  % \fancybreak{\pfbreakdisplay}

  \subsubsection{``File of Life''}

  If you have any medical conditions that emergency personnel might
  need to know about in case of an emergency, please pick up a ``File
  of Life'' form from Registration. This is a great tool for you to
  keep pertinent medical history on hand in case you become
  unconscious or unable to speak. These forms are kept with you, so
  place them in an easy-to-find location. It might also be a good idea
  to let someone close to you know where it is so they can help.

  \subsection{Pool Rules}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textsc{No Swimming} without a Camp Lifeguard present.
    Please treat the Camp Lifeguards with respect at all times.
  \item All FPG and campground rules must be followed. See the signs
    posted near the pool.
  \item For your safety, no one is allowed on the docks, pool deck,
    or beach after dark.
  \end{itemize}

\section{Getting Around}

\begin{multicols}{2}

  \subsection{Trolley}

  The FPG Trolley runs from 8am to 2am along a continuous circuit
  around the site. Just wait at any Trolley Stop and the Trolley will
  pick you up and drop you off at any other Trolley Stop. Trolley Stop
  signs are distinctive vertical signs that are bright green on the
  side facing the approaching trolley. (Check the map for the route.)

  Minors may \emph{not} ride the Trolley without a parent present.

  No food, beverages ({\small unless in a closed container}), nor
  smoking are permitted on the Taxi or Trolley (or any other TEG
  carts).

  \fancybreak{\pfbreakdisplay}

  \subsection{Taxi Service}

  If you need more personal door-to-door service, then call for a
  Taxi. Just ask any Staff Member to radio a Taxi to pick you up. You
  can also schedule a Taxi pick-up ahead of time; or see Aurora, our
  Taxi Lugal, to make arrangements.

  % \fancybreak{\pfbreakdisplay}

    Trolley Service & \indent 8am & -- & 2am \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}


  \columnbreak

  \subsection{Personal Vehicles}

  All cars, vans, trucks, etc. must be parked in the parking lot once
  you have unloaded.

  If you leave during Festival, stop at the front gate on your way
  back in, and ask a staff member to call a Taxi to meet you at the
  parking lot; or, catch the Trolley at the Trolley Stop near the Main
  Gate to convey you back to your campsite or cabin.

  \vspace{8pt}

  Electric personal mobility devices \emph{are} permitted on site.

  \subsubsection{The Forest}

  Our new site has an amazing wooded area for camping; however, campers
  will \emph{not} be allowed to bring their vehicles into the camping
  area after dusk. Campers will be asked to unload their vehicles at the
  edge of the Forest and carry items to their sites.

  \subsubsection{Handicapped Parking}

  Each vehicle MUST have a State issued Handicapped Placard or License
  Plate or a FPG issued Parking Tag to park in the Handicapped
  Parking area.

  \subsubsection{RV Camping Area}

  No tents are permitted in the RV Camping area, and once your RV,
  pop-up camper, van, or travel trailer is parked in the RV camping
  area it may not be moved until end of festival.

\end{multicols}


\section{Communications \& Staff}

\begin{multicols}{2}

  \subsection{Radios \& Walkie-Talkies}

  Having personal radios on site to help keep track of your family,
  especially your children, is an excellent idea!

  If you have your own radios to use while at FPG please set them to
  \textbf{channels 11 and above}; channels 10 and below are in use by
  the FPG Staff.

  % \fancybreak{\pfbreakdisplay}

  \subsection{Emerald City  {\small (Board of Directors)}}

  Got a burning question, comment or suggestion?  Do you just want to
  sit and have a good conversation about FPG?  Then head on over to
  Emerald City and walk right in.  Grab a chair and sit down in the
  kitchen for a nice chat with any of our friendly Board Members.

  Is there a problem?  Did something happen?  Do you need some advice?
  Emerald City is the place to go for these issues as well...even at
  4am!  Just come on in and knock on the inner door, its never to late
  or too early to get some help!

  % \fancybreak{\pfbreakdisplay}

  \subsection{Ministry of Magic {\small (Staff Office)}}

  Our office for the Festival is located between the Blue Room and
  Dining Hall.

  Our Office staff will be happy to assist you with finding
  information, arranging Taxi service, or locating another staff
  member to assist you further.

  \subsubsection{Community Service}

  For each volunteer shift that you perform, you'll earn another entry
  into a raffle for prizes that include half-off or a free admission
  to your next FPG!

  Sign up with the Ministry of Magick office.

%  \fancybreak{\pfbreakdisplay}

  \subsection{FPG Community Center}

  Between \& after meal times, the Dining Hall is available for
  everyone to use.

  Please be respectful of others using the space, and clean up
  after yourself.

  A Charging Station for your electronic devices can be found in the
  Dining Hall. {\small You're responsible for keeping an eye on your
    devices while they charge.}

  All who identify as girls or women are welcome to come share coffee,
  cookies and conversations in a beautiful and comfortable space

  \begingroup
  \setlength{\columnsep}{6pt}%
  \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.5\columnwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=.5\columnwidth]{FSL.png}
  \end{wrapfigure}

  Father Sky Lodge (FSL) is a group effort of Pagan men to provide
  support and resources to their community in order to encourage the
  exploration of Male Spirituality, the Male Mysteries and to return The
  Masculine Divine/God to a place of balance within Neopagan
  spirituality. It allows Pagan men to come together in fellowship and
  brotherhood.

  Our goal is to create a place where anyone, man or woman, can come
  with questions about masculine Pagan Spirituality, and know that
  there would be answers; a place where any member of our Pagan
  community can freely ask ``Can you help me?'' on matters related to
  Pagan Men, and know that the answer will always be a resounding
  ``Yes!''

  We are a brother group with Sisterhood of the Shield and work with
  them to support each other in our Spiritual journeys.

  \endgroup

  \subsection{Art Abandonment Project}

  The faeries are at it again! Keep your eyes open for random gifts of
  love just for us at FPG!

  If you find these little packages of fun marked ``FAE GIFT thanks to
  The Art Abandonment Project,'' they are yours to keep, trade or give
  to a loved one or friend!  All gifts will be randomly found around
  the campsite over the week except Vendors' Row (which is off-limits)
  \ldots Happy Beltane from the Fae!

  \subsection{Sisterhood of the Shield}

  \begingroup
  \setlength{\columnsep}{6pt}%
  \begin{wrapfigure}{l}{.5\columnwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=.5\columnwidth]{sts.png}
  \end{wrapfigure}

  Sisterhood of the Shield (StS) is a women’s-only group. Though we
  embrace the traditional aspects of womanhood, we also seek the more
  primal and earthy energy; a place where the warrior women and other
  such traditions are as welcome as the maiden, mother and crone.

  We have an Equalist mentality: Men and Women are equal but there are
  things that each experience that only someone of their own gender can
  understand.

  We are a sister group with Father Sky Lodge and work with them to
  support each other in our Spiritual journeys.

  \subsection{Tween Time}

  'Tween-agers have their special place to hang out and express
  themseves at Festival, too.

  \subsection{Teen Forge}

  The Teen Forge is a place set aside for teens, 13-17. The tent is
  yours to use. Come and go as you wish. Bring snacks and soft drinks to
  share. Bring your ideas, your complaints, your sense of humor, and
  your friendship. There will also be workshops and activities for you
  throughout the weekend. Are there activities you wish to have next
  festival? See the Teen Leader and make suggestions.

  \subsection{Rules of The Forge}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Do not disrespect each other. {\small (Joking is ok.)}
  \item If you break it, fix it; if you can’t fix it, pay for it.
  \item If you borrow anything, tell the Teen Leader and give it back
    the next day
  \item If this becomes too much like work, it's time to do
    something different.
  \item Be excellent to each other.
  \item Don’t do anything Dumb. \\
    {\small (``Dumb'' is defined as anything that requires more than
      \$20 or 20 minutes to fix.)}
  \item All FPG festival rules apply.
  \end{enumerate}

  \subsection{Kids' Realm}

  Drop off your kids at the Kids' Realm tent for supervised playtime
  and workshops while you set-up your campsite, go shopping on
  Vendor’s Row, attend your own workshops, or just relax with friends!
  Be assured in the knowledge that your precious little witches and
  wizards are safe, happily playing together, and learning from some
  of our awesome presenters.

  Kids’ Realm is open Wed-Sat, from 1pm-5:30pm. Please pick up your 
  children \emph{by} 5:30pm 

  Kids’ Realm is for children who are Potty Trained up to age 12.
  Please advise Kids’ Realm staff of any allergies, etc. that your
  child(ren) may have. Also make sure to apply sunscreen and/or bug
  spray to your children before dropping them off. FPG does not
  supply them.

  In case of inclement weather, Kids’ Realm will move into the Dining
  Hall, please pick up/drop off there.

  When dropping off your child(ren) please advise the staff where you
  can be reached should we need to find you. 

  If your child(ren) attend(s) Kids’ Realm, at least one
  parent/guardian must volunteer for 2 hours at Kids’ Realm, we cannot
  do this without you! Please sign up for your shift the first time
  you drop off your child(ren).

\section{FPG Traditions}
\begin{multicols}{2}

  \subsection{Celtic Games}

  Celtic Games is an event that remembers days long past when kingdoms
  fought for control, power, riches, and territory; when kings and
  queens chose their champions to limit loss of life upon the
  battlefield. Will you be brave enough, strong enough, quick enough,
  or witty enough to take the coveted crown for your own and become
  King or Queen of FPG Celtic Games. 

  Lay on --- and may the most skilled sword claim victory!

  All ages are required to sign a consent \& liability form. Ages 5-12
  require a parent present; ages 5-17 require parental consent.

  \subsection{Fire Temple Drum Altar}

  The Drum \& Dance Altar is a place for participants \& performers to
  go to gain refreshment and sustenance (both physically and
  spiritually). It is built for the Community and by the Community.
  
  It would be appreciated if you would bring donation items to the
  drum circle before 10pm each night.

  Possible contributions include: blankets, rugs, tables, hay bales,
  candles, flowers, fruits, drinks, granola bars, and other midnight
  snacks. If you have any questions, stop by the Shiny Happy People Drum
  Tribe booth on Vendors’ Row anytime during the festival.

  \subsection{Inipi Sweat Lodge} \label{sweatlodge}

  All should bring a blanket with which to cover the Lodge. The Lodge
  is made up of a frame constructed out of willow branches. The Lodge
  must be covered completely to hold in the heat and block out any
  light. Bringing your own blanket puts your personal energy into the
  construction of the Lodge.

  This ceremony is approached in a humble and peaceful manner. Around
  the sacred fire is the place to center ourselves and connect with
  the Creator prior to entering the Lodge.

  In the Apache tradition, we go into the Lodge as we came into the
  world, without clothing.  The Lodge represents the womb of the
  Mother Earth. We will wear a towel wrapped around us outside the
  Lodge and then drop the towels once inside. Pride, ego, and false
  modesty are left at the door. We enter as equals and are only
  concerned once inside with our own prayers. We are never concerned
  about what people look like or what others think about how we
  look. We enter the womb, die a symbolic spiritual death, and emerge
  reborn and renewed.

  As in all ceremonies, there needs to be a balance. An exchange of
  energy between the participants and the facilitator (water pourer)
  and fire tender must take place. Tobacco is a traditional gift, but
  whatever Spirit moves you to give is good as long as it comes from
  the heart.

  There is no charge for the ceremony --- just an exchange of energy
  for balance. Some people leave crafted items, objects from nature,
  books, CDs, etc. Some people leave nothing at all as they may be
  financially unable to give something. An exchange of energy can
  still take place through writing a poem, giving a big hug to the
  facilitator, etc. Whatever the case, it is ``all good'' if the gifts
  come from the heart.

  If you have any special items you want blessed with the energy of
  the ceremony, by all means, bring them and place them on the
  altar. People have brought pipes, ritual objects, and pictures of
  friends, family, and ancestors that have crossed over.

  % \fancybreak{\pfbreakdisplay}

  \subsection{Coming Of Age}

  \subsubsection{Rite of Passage in Progress}

  As you enjoy FPG Beltane, you will probably notice a select few
  individuals who often seem to be wearing all white. You might notice
  them being led blindfolded through camp by a crowd of adults,
  attending workshops, helping people around site, speaking with
  various Elders, and generally looking exhausted, excited, and/or
  frantic due to mild sleep deprivation and busy schedules. These
  oddly dressed people are going through a Coming of Age
  ceremony. Please join our \emph{Celebration of the Victorious} down
  at Fire Circle following Main Ritual, where we will present our new
  Adults to their Community.

  \vspace{6pt}

  {\small If you or someone you know is interested in participating in
    (or helping with) the Coming of Age ordeal, please contact Sage
    when he's over near Lodge 7, or at
    \texttt{Sage@star-hope.org}. Participants must be age 18--24 at
    next Beltane.}

  \subsection{FPG Wants You!}

  If you've got some time and want to give back to the community, visit
  the Ministry of Magick office (near the Blue Room) to sign up for a
  Community Service volunteer shift --- you could even win free
  admission to your next FPG!

  Do you like making things happen? Giving back to your Community?
  Being a part of something Magikal? If you said ``Yes!'' to any of
  the above --- then we have a job for \emph{you}!

  TEG is always looking for good, reliable people to fill staff
  positions. There is a job for every type of person and ability, from
  sit-down jobs to physical activity, between \& during festivals.

  \subsubsection{The Perks} by becoming a Staff member your
  registration fee is reduced, and you get to come to festival 1-2
  days early! Additional perks include the Staff Ritual on Tuesday
  night, free Coffee, Tea \& Water from Apollo’s Coffee Shop, and the
  Annual Staff Retreat \& Meeting!

  If you are interested, talk to Medea and/or send an email to:
  \texttt{staffing@flapagan.org}
  \section{Life Events}


  FPG wants to make it possible for our guests to have and participate
  in Life Event Rituals on site at FPG, including Handfastings,
  Weddings, Wiccanings, Initiations, Coming of Age Rituals, Elevations,
  Requiems, Cronings, Sagings, Coven Births, etc.

  \vspace{6pt}

  If you are interested in having a Life Event at Festival, please talk
  to Medea or email \texttt{lifeevents1@flapagan.org}


  % \fancybreak{\pfbreakdisplay}


  \subsection{Calling all Covens \& Groups}

  Each Festival, the Florida Pagan Gathering becomes a special
  community because you --- our guests --- bond together to create a
  family of like-minded people. To help promote this, FPG encourages
  Covens, Groups, \& Friends to host the Meet \& Greets and the Main
  Rituals at each festival.  

  If you are interested in hosting a future Meet \& Greet, drop a note
  to \texttt{workshops@flapagan.org}; or, if you are interested in
  hosting a Main Ritual, talk to any Board Member at Emerald City, or
  contact them at \texttt{tegbod@flapagan.org}
