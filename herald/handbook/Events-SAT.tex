\label{Sat-Mage3}

 In Part 2 of Evolutionary Astrology for Pagans, we will continue to explore the  ``Soul's intention''  approach of Evolutionary Astrology. Once the natal chart has revealed the Soul's nature and desires coming into this lifetime as we learn in Part 1, we then wish to look forward. We come to understand the Soul's challenge(s) via the birth chart and we now seek the chart's insight regarding how to meet them. Working under the assumption that the Soul knows what this lifetime is intended to teach, and that the birth chart carries the Soul's message, we look to the birth chart to reveal the Soul's direction for this incarnation.   {\small (Ages 13 and up)}

\subsubsection{Concepts of Deity}
\label{Sat-Cypress3}
{\small Cypress $\bullet$  Sanctuary}

 Among paganfolk, we find everything from hard polytheist/devotional polytheists to comfortably convinced atheists who like the community and values, in many permutations. So-- how does the way you experience the divine influence your experience and practice as a pagan? How can all these belief structures co-exist? How does the way you worship effect who you *are* as a spiritual being and a person? How do you decide who and how to worship? Can you be a "bad pagan"? This class is aimed at the relative newcomer, but I'm glad to have courteous input from other leaders/teachers about how they handle these questions. This is a class that Dancing Otters teaches fairly early on in our open class on Wicca, before the class on tending shrines and on patrons. It's mostly lecture and discussion. {\small (Ages 10 -- 21)}

\subsubsection{Satan, Demons and Hell - Why Are They in the Grimoires?}
\label{Sat-Leitch3}
{\small Aaron Leitch $\bullet$  Arts \& Crafts}

 For hundreds of years, the Western grimoires have been decried as evil texts full of appeals to Satanic entities, by which magicians sell their souls to the Great Enemy in return for temporary wealth or power here on Earth.  In recent decades, these texts have re-emerged into our culture - this time viewed in a more egalitarian light.  After all, there are grimoires full of angels and nature spirits who have no connection to the infernal realm.  There is really nothing "Satanic" about these books.  However...

While it is true most of this negative reputation is thanks to aggressive anti-occult propaganda from the Church, the grimoires themselves must bear some of the blame.  While there are plenty of angelic grimoires out there, it cannot be denied there are countless examples of grimoires that really do call upon Satan, Lucifer, Leviathan, Belial, Asmodeus, Baal, Lilith and hundreds (maybe thousands) of other denizens of hell.  This made it very easy for the Church to hold the texts up as proof that they are, in fact, devilish at heart.

Yet the European medieval/renaissance grimoires were primarily produced by devout Christians.  The image of the de-frocked priest performing Satanic Masses behind closed doors is not only the stuff of urban legend, but nothing remotely like it appears in the grimoires. Even the spells that call exclusively upon the rulers of Hell still make prayers and appeals to the Highest God to accomplish their goals.  So these people weren't Satan worshippers or even demonolaters - but that leaves us to question:  why in the world would devout Christian mystics even include Satan or anything hellish in their grimoires?  And, of course, what does that mean for those of us using the same texts today?

You might find the answer surprising - but more importantly you will see how the answer is vital to the Western mysteries, and to all of us attempting to revive the Old Magick in the modern world.  This lecture might just change how you think magick works! {\small (All ages)}

\subsubsection{Honoring the God and Celebrating 20 years of Florida Pagan Gathering}
\label{Sat-RITUAL}
{\small  Main Ritual Circle}

 At FPG Samhain Keepers of the Earth will lead a Rite to reconnect with our Honored Ancestors and Beloved Kin who now live beyond the veil. We shall reconnect with the people both familial and extraordinary who touched our lives, influencing who we have become, shaping our visions and our paths. We shall honor these Ancestors as our heroes. For what is a hero? To us a hero is someone whose impact on us cannot be measured.
 
There is a Yoruba proverb that says  ``We stand on the shoulders of our Ancestors.''  According to St. Augustine, the meaning of the Latin word for religion means  ``to reconnect.'' 
 
This ritual of reconnection shall utilize the power of a Druid ceremony, the essential magic of witchcraft, and the ancestral veneration of Asatru. Everyone who participates will have the opportunity to reconnect with their Heroes beyond the veil as we remember all Honored Ancestors with devotion and love. {\small (All ages)}
